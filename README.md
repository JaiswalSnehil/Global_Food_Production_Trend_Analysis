# Global_Food_Production_Trend_Analysis

Problem Statement
Food production is fundamental to global food security and economic stability. However, increasing global demand, climate change, resource depletion, and trade disruptions pose significant challenges to agricultural output. Understanding food production trends is crucial for policymakers, agribusinesses, and farmers to optimize crop yields and ensure food availability.
The challenge lies in aggregating and analyzing six decades of food production data across different regions, agricultural techniques, and economic policies. Power BI can enable stakeholders to visualize trends, identify risks, and forecast future production needs.

Social Impact:
Understanding food production trends helps address food security challenges, optimize supply chain efficiency, and develop sustainable agricultural policies.
Business Model / Impact:
Revenue streams include subscriptions to agricultural trend reports, consulting for agribusinesses, API services for supply chain companies, and insights for government policy planning.
